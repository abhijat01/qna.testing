The office moved to Princeton, New Jersey and incorporated as a legal entity in 2002. We are a subsidiary of Taiho Pharmaceutical Company (TPC). Our original Company name was Taiho Pharma USA, Inc. (TPUI) from 2002 through 2014, and then we changed it to Taiho Oncology, Inc. (TOI) to emphasize our focus on the oncology market. The Company has evolved from a small development organization to a fully functional center of excellence developing and commercializing cancer compounds for the West with over 200 employees.

Bonding Time must be taken on a continuous basis and cannot be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule.

Under the ‘‘rolling’’ 12-month period, each time an employee takes FMLA leave, the remaining leave entitlement would be the balance of the 12 weeks that has not been used during the immediately preceding 12 months.Example: Michael requests three weeks of FMLA leave to begin on July 31st. The employer looks back 12 months (from July 31st back to the previous August 1st) to see if any FMLA leave had been used. Michael had not taken any previous FMLA leave, so he is entitled to the three weeks he requested and has nine more weeks available.Note: Employees may be eligible for additional leave entitlement or benefits under state or local laws, which shall run concurrently with one another and with Bonding Time.\n",

The medical certification must be provided within 15 days after the leave is requested, or as soon as reasonably possible under the circumstances. The short-term disability certification may be sufficient where the information required is duplicative. Failure to provide requested medical certification in a timely manner may result in denial of leave until such certification is provided. Taiho, at its expense, may require an examination by a second health care provider if it reasonably doubts the medical certification the employee initially provides. If the second health care provider’s opinion conflicts with the original medical certification, Taiho, at its expense, may require a third, mutually agreeable health care provider to conduct an examination and provide a final and binding opinion.

Once the employee enrolls in this continuation of coverage (COBRA), coverage will become effective the first of the month following the month the terminated employee last worked. COBRA also provides qualified beneficiaries the option to continue the same medical, dental and vision plans that had been in-force when coverage terminated. Terminated employees and/or their beneficiaries will be charged the cost of the premium plus a 2% administration fee.Life Insurance, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and both Short- and Long-Term Disability Coverages will end on the employee’s last active day at work. Life Insurance may be continued by the terminated employee, a covered spouse, or a covered child or children.
